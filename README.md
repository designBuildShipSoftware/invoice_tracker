# Invoice Tracker

A [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) back end for managing invoices.

## Motivation

In one of my past jobs I was responsible for handling the bulk of our invoicing process. Unfortunately the software that we used was rigid and abstract. Not only did it not reflect the actual process that our invoices went through, but it made it difficult to handle even the most simple things like tracking, inserting, and updating. Even worse, it was baked into a larger ecosystem and was clearly not a priority for the maintainers.

What this resulted in for my coworkers and me was a lot of headaches trying to make the broken system usable by supplementing it with excel spreadsheets.

Not great.

## Mission

Make a simple, malleable back end that focuses on verifying and storing invoice data, that's it. I believe that the client should have the power to control their data and that further restrictions should be handled at a higher level. Invoice Tracker's job is to provide a simple, well-documented API so that it can be accessed with ease and used by anything.

## Documentation

Invoice Tracker is still in the early stages of development. Once the database collections and schema are fleshed out and the routes constructed, documentation will soon follow.

## Thanks

To all of the hard working men and women out there. It's the possibility of making your lives easier that makes me excited to code.
